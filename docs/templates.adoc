Thus far, page rendering has been based on mappings, or editorially composing one page at a time. In this chapter you'll learn how to make page templates - and reuse them across multiple content items.

## Task: Movie details part

To complete this section, we'll need one final part for listing movie details. The content type and content for movies already exists in Enonic, so lets get to work.

. **Add the `movie-details` part to Enonic** - same procedure as before...
+
.src/main/resources/site/parts/movie-details/movie-details.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<part xmlns="urn:enonic:xp:model:1.0">
    <display-name>Movie Details</display-name>
    <description>Show details of a movie</description>
    <form/>
</part>
----
+
. **Redeploy** the Enonic app.
+
. **Add the Movie query and view** in Next.
+
.src/components/parts/MovieDetails.tsx
[source,JavaScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/parts/MovieDetails.tsx[]
----
. **Update the component mappings**:
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import MovieDetails, {getMovie} from './parts/MovieDetails';

// Part mappings
ComponentRegistry.addPart(`${APP_NAME}:movie-details`, {
    query: getMovie,
    view: MovieDetails
});

----

== Task: Create template

With the new component registered, let's put it to use.

. In Content Studio, select and **edit your favorite movie** (or choose "No time to die" if you have no faviorites).
+
. **Activate the page editor** by pressing `Display` icon in the top right screen corner, select the "Main page" descriptor and **add the "Movie details" part** to the page.
+

+
We now have a single movie nicely presented, but it would be cumbersome to manually configure each movie like this - page templates to the rescue.
+
. In the page editor, **select the page (root) component** (for instance by clicking on the header).
+
image:movie-page.png[title="With page component selected, save as template appears in right hand panel",width=1440px]
+
. Click **Save as template** from the right hand panel.
+
This will create a new page template content item, and open it in a new tab for editing.
+
. **Give your template a better name**, such as "Movie details" and save the changes.
+
image:movie-template.png[title="Content item of type template, configure to support movie items",width=1440px]
+
. Try visiting other movie items to **verify they now automatically render**.PS!Don't forget to publish the changes and the new page template.

With templates sorted out, let's dive into  <<static.adoc#, production mode and page revalidation>>.
