In this chapter, you'll build a tree structure of your content, with a site item at the root + learn about a handy trick for the GraphQL API.

== Introduction

Next.XP is built to provide complete control over a website, including landing pages and the URL structure. For this use-case, Content Studio's tree structure will come in handy.

== Task: Creating the site

Next.XP needs a root content item. This item will act as the front-page of your site.

TIP: Before you continue, clear all selections in the Content Studio list view (this way the site content will be placed on the project root).

. **Create a new item** by clicking `New` in Content Studio toolbar, then select the `Site` content type. This will open the content editor in a new tab.
. **Give the site a name** by filling in a display name for the site, "HMDB" (short for Headless Movie DB) will do fine. 
+
NOTE: If you choose a different name, make sure the site path name (seen below the Display name) is set to `hmdb` - as this will be used throughout the tutorial.
. **Add the Movie DB app** to the site - by selecting it in the `Applications` form field.
+
NOTE: Sites acts as scopes in the content structure. By adding an app to the site, you effectively allow editors to create content based on the app within this scope.

+
When completed, your form should look something like this, and you can now press `Save` in the toolbar.
+
NOTE: This will leave the item in `In progress` state, which is ok for now.

== Add content

To quickly get some content and structure within the site, let's move the Movie DB content into the site.

. **Select the folders** in the list, and click `Move` from the toolbar. 
. **Selecting the `HMDB` site** as the target and click `Move` once more.
+

+
. Wrap up by **publishing the changes**. Select the site (root item) in the tree structure, and click `Mark as ready...` in the top right action button. This will bring up the Publishing Wizard.
+

+
. To **publish the entire new tree structure** select the hierarchy icon to the left of the site. This will expand to include all items that have been moved as well. Then click `Publish Now`

Sweet, you should now have a site with content and a basic tree structure. 




== Task: Site contextual queries

In GraphQL queries, you may use a so-called "site context". This is activated by passing an HTTP header along with the query. 

. Specify header
+
Back in Query Playground, open the `Request Headers` panel at the bottom, and add the following configuration:
+
.Configure HTTP headers
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "X-Guillotine-SiteKey": "/hmdb"
}
----
+
NOTE: SiteKey can be either path, or the site's unique ID. A benefit of using the ID is that you can change the name and path of the site, without affecting your queries.
+
. Run a query with the site context
+
One of the new features you get from the site context is the `${site}` placeholder, which can be used in paths. Update your Query Variables as follows, and run the movie query from the previous chapter once more: 
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "path": "${site}/movies/se7en"
}
----

NOTE: Here, `${site}` will resolve to the path of the site and expand - in this case the full path will be expanded to `/hmdb/movies/se7en`.
